Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.\",\n",
       "       b'I have been known to fall asleep during films, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot. However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish. The plot development was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why. I admit, I may have missed part of the film, but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else. I cant recommend this film at all.',\n",
       "       b'Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.',\n",
       "       b'This is the kind of film for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours. Wonderful performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently row the plot along. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle through New York life at its best. A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.',\n",
       "       b'As others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued, but when no \"men\" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love.',\n",
       "       b\"This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in, effected by, or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and its symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so spectacular in 'Where the Truth Lies'. I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools, as you will never see a better on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding, and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Her emotional range is so precise, each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma, on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as Lohman's. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another. This film is really an astonishing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like nature films best, this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we don't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair, then we are dead inside.\",\n",
       "       b'Okay, you have:<br /><br />Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She\\'s killed off in the first scene - that\\'s right, folks; this show has no backbone!<br /><br />Peter O\\'Toole as Ol\\' Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor.<br /><br />Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. It\\'s alright, they have Col. Cricket\\'s full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes \\'round for Christmas!) Still, she\\'s considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!)<br /><br />David McCallum as said toy-boy, equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldn\\'t come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus.<br /><br />and finally:<br /><br />Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls\\' Boarding-School, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: \"I\\'ve only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world.\" Well, we can\\'t say they didn\\'t warn us.<br /><br />Ah, Susan - time was, your character would have been running the whole show. They don\\'t write \\'em like that any more. Our loss, not yours.<br /><br />So - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of \"Brideshead Revisited,\" right?<br /><br />Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!)<br /><br />First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - \"hey, it\\'s just the sunlight!\"<br /><br />Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying, her eyes are moist. That\\'s the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is \"dewy-eyed.\"<br /><br />Henceforth, Leading Lady shall be known as L.L.<br /><br />Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when she\\'s in love. Still, I\\'ll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?)<br /><br />And lastly, fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is \"Mrs.\" She\\'s either \"Miss\" or \"Lady.\"<br /><br />When all was said and done, I still couldn\\'t tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldn\\'t even tell you what was said and done.<br /><br />To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all.<br /><br />OK, at the end, L.L. finds she\\'s lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (there\\'s always a \"meanwhile,\") some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when, I don\\'t know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHE\\'s going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be \"whisked away\" SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!)<br /><br />Great drama.',\n",
       "       b'The film is based on a genuine 1950s novel.<br /><br />Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three \"London novels\": \"Absolute Beginners\", \"City of Spades\" and \"Mr Love and Justice\". I have read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, perhaps an experiment that did not come off. But McInnes\\'s work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so. This musical is the novelist\\'s ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one\\'s mind being turned into a glitzy, badly-acted, soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s London, and does nothing of the sort.<br /><br />Thank goodness Colin McInnes wasn\\'t alive to witness it.',\n",
       "       b'I really love the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress\\'s that appeared in them. They found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn\\'t matter if they could act (Remember \"Candy\"?). The reason I was disappointed by this film was because it wasn\\'t nostalgic enough. The story here has a European sci-fi film called \"Dragonfly\" being made and the director is fired. So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) to complete the picture. They\\'re is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays Dragonfly but she\\'s barely in it. Film is written and directed by Roman Coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script. I wish the film could have been an homage to those early films. They could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. There is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell appear as well. I guess I\\'m going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties. If any are reading this, \"Make it as sexy as you can\"! I\\'ll be waiting!',\n",
       "       b'Sure, this one isn\\'t really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position. \"Dieter\" is the first name of a quite popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography \"Dieter Bohlen\" wrote a few years ago but isn\\'t meant to be accurate on that. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for American standard) which is either amusing (not for the other \"actors\" of course) or dumb - it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a \"Bohlen\"-Fan or not. Technically speaking there isn\\'t much to criticize. Speaking of me I find this movie to be an OK-movie.'],\n",

       "       b' The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nI can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \\t1\\nIn other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \\t1\\nHow can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \\t1\\nIt\\'s quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \\t1\\nYes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \\t1\\nThis short film certainly pulls no punches.  \\t0\\nGraphics is far from the best part of the game.  \\t0\\nThis is the number one best TH game in the series.  \\t1\\nIt deserves strong love.  \\t1\\nIt is an insane game.  \\t1\\nThere are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it\\'s just a massive game.  \\t1\\nWaste your money on this game.  \\t1\\nThis is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \\t1\\nActually, the graphics were good at the time.  \\t1\\nToday the graphics are crap.  \\t0\\nAs they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \\t1\\nThis game rocks.  \\t1\\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s PURE BRILLIANCE.  \\t1\\nThis was a flick doomed from its conception.  \\t0\\nThe very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \\t0\\nI wasn\\'t the least bit interested.  \\t0\\nNot only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I\\'m not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \\t0\\nBut it\\'s just not funny.  \\t0\\nBut even the talented Carrell can\\'t save this.  \\t0\\nHis co-stars don\\'t fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \\t0\\nThe story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \\t0\\nThe only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I\\'ve ever seen.  \\t0\\nBut whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn\\'t translate to quality, that\\'s for sure.  \\t0\\nThe film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad the film didn\\'t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \\t1\\nIn addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \\t1\\nOn the negative, it\\'s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \\t0\\nLong, whiny and pointless.  \\t0\\nBut I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \\t0\\nExcellent cast, story line, performances.  \\t1\\nTotally believable.  \\t1\\nAnne Heche was utterly convincing.  \\t1\\nSam Shepard\\'s portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \\t1\\nI sat riveted to the TV screen.  \\t1\\nAll in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \\t1\\nI do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \\t1\\nI enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \\t1\\nI was very disappointed in the movie.  \\t0\\nOne character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \\t0\\nThere is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \\t0\\nThere was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \\t0\\nThis movie totally grates on my nerves.  \\t0\\nThe performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they\\'re delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \\t0\\nAnd, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \\t0\\nOften the dialogue doesn\\'t really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \\t0\\nIt crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \\t0\\nThere are some generally great things in it.  \\t1\\nI wouldn\\'t say they\\'re worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \\t0\\nThe suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \\t1\\nI especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \\t1\\nIf you want a movie that\\'s not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \\t1\\nAlexander Nevsky is a great film.  \\t1\\nHe is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn\\'t do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It\\'s gonna help movie makers who aren\\'t in the very restrained movie business\" of Qu\\xc3\\xa9bec.  ',\n",

',\n",
       "       b' In fact, it\\'s hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \\t1\\nRay Charles is legendary.  \\t1\\nRay Charles\\' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  \\t1\\nHitchcock is a great director.  \\t1\\nIronically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \\t0\\nSecondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \\t0\\nHence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \\t0\\nThe plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  \\t0\\nThere are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \\t0\\nMishima is extremely uninteresting.  \\t0\\nThis is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \\t0\\nThe flat reenactments don\\'t hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \\t0\\nAnd the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  \\t0\\nHe can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \\t0\\nSchrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \\t0\\nWhen I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \\t1\\nI was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \\t1\\nHowever, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \\t0\\nI mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \\t0\\nThe character developments also lacked in depth.  \\t0\\nWoa, talk about awful.  \\t0\\nDo not waste your time.  \\t0\\nIt was just too horrible.  \\t0\\nThe worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \\t0\\nBut what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \\t0\\nThe poor actors.  \\t0\\nYou can\\'t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \\t0\\nIf you check the director\\'s filmography on this site you will see why this film didn\\'t have a chance.  \\t0\\nThis would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \\t0\\nIf good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \\t1\\nThe film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \\t1\\nRegrettably, the film fails.  \\t0\\nThe movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \\t0\\nNo actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \\t0\\nYet, I enjoy watching it.  \\t1\\nUnfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \\t0\\nBad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \\t0\\nThe dialogue sucked.  \\t0\\nThe cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \\t0\\nThe soundtrack sucked.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucked.  \\t0\\nThe concert sequences just sucked.  \\t0\\nThat was nice.  \\t1\\nThat was funny.  \\t1\\nIt was so funny.  \\t1\\nOverall, this movie was cheap trash.  \\t0\\nBut this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \\t0\\nI came out of it feeling angry.  \\t0\\n***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can\\'t) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \\t1\\nThe cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \\t1\\nConceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \\t1\\nAnd there wasn\\'t a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \\t1\\nAll things considered, a job very well done.  \\t1\\nThanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \\t1\\nOne of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \\t1\\nIt ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \\t1\\nThe attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \\t1\\nIt is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \\t1\\nUp there with the best of Melville.  \\t1\\nEverything about this film is simply incredible.  \\t1\\nYou truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \\t1\\nBLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it\\'s limitations (it\\'s an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \\t1\\nThe performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that\\'s because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \\t1\\nI thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \\t1\\nI\\'m not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \\t0\\nIf it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \\t0\\nThere is a lot of beautiful places.  \\t1\\nIt was forced, like everything in this movie.  \\t0\\nAgain, lame.  \\t0\\nHere\\'s where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \\t0\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  \\t0\\nWhen I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \\t0\\nSummary: The witticisms weren\\'t witty.  \\t0\\nThe plot - well, I said I\\'d let that one go.  \\t0\\nThe acting was bad.  \\t0\\nReally bad.  \\t0\\nEven Billy Bob couldn\\'t rise above the script, which was worse.  \\t0\\nCamerawork - again, bad.  \\t0\\nRating: 1 out of 10.  \\t0\\nAn AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \\t1\\nKieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \\t1\\nHe is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nHis use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  \\t1\\nThree of the most visually appealing movies i\\'ve ever seen.  \\t1\\nAnd his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \\t1\\nI have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \\t1\\nI couldn\\'t think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \\t1\\nI recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \\t1\\n10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  \\t1\\nI literally vomited while watching this film.  \\t0\\nI think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth\\'s pearls.  \\t1\\nhis performance, as awarded, was stunning.  \\t1\\nthe story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \\t1\\nIn a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \\t1\\nAll in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola\\'s roeg wih a sublime cast.  \\t1\\nI\\'m translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \\t0\\nBut when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap\".  ',\n",

      "What on earth is Irons doing in this film?\n",
      "I just saw this film and I recommend it.\n",
      "It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.\n",
      "A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.\n",
      "Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.\n",
      "Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.\n",
      "Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.\n",
      "In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.\n",
      "Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).\n",
      "I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.\n",
      "I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.\n",
      "The football scenes at the end were perplexing.\n",
      "But I thought his acting was skilled.\n",
      "Meredith M was better than all right.\n",
      "A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.\n",
      "It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.\n",
      "Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.\n",
      "This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.\n",
      "This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.\n",
      "A standout scene.\n",
      "This scene is very strong and unpleasant.\n",
      "Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.\n",
      "It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.\n",
      "The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.\n",
      "I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.\n",
      "This movie is also revealing.\n",
      "Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.\n",
      "And it was boring.\n",
      "I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.\n",
      "PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.\n",
      "It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.\n",
      "An Italian reviewer called this \"a small, great film,\" and that's right.\n",
      "All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.\n",
      "You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.\n",
      "The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the \"acting coach\" are fascinating.\n",
      "Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.\n",
      "You won't forget this movie!\n",
      "Why was this film made?\n",
      "The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.\n",
      "The result is a film that just don't look right.\n",
      "None of them are engaging or exciting.\n",
      "The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.\n",
      "The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.\n",
      "I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was \"The Stranger\" and I loved it.\n",
      "But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.\n",
      "This movie is so awesome!\n",
      "I loved it, it was really scary.\n",
      "I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.\n",
      "If you want a real scare rent this one!\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "This is an extraordinary film.\n",
      "As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.\n",
      "This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.\n",
      "The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.\n",
      "This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.\n",
      "Predictable, but not a bad watch.\n",
      "It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.\n",
      "She carries the movie well.\n",
      "Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.\n",
      "It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.\n",
      "How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.\n",
      "In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.\n",
      "Avoid at ALL costs!\n",
      "Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.\n",
      "The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.\n",
      "The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.\n",
      "The only place good for this film is in the garbage.\n",
      "The worst one of the series.\n",
      "Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.\n",
      "When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.\n",
      "Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.\n",
      "Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.\n",
      "This film offers many delights and surprises.\n",
      "When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from \"Don Giovanni\" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.\n",
      "The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.\n",
      "You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.\n",
      "But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.\n",
      "The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.\n",
      "You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.\n",
      "The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.\n",
      "The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.\n",
      "Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.\n",
      "Conclusion - I loved it.\n",
      "It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.\n",
      "I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.\n",
      "Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.\n",
      "It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.\n",
      "The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.\n",
      "Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!\n",
      "Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.\n",
      "Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).\n",
      "See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.\n",
      "See both films if you can.\n",
      "It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella \"The Dead.\n",
      "Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.\n",
      "Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.\n",
      "It's very slow.\n",
      "Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.\n",
      ") Don't waste your time.\n",
      "End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.\n",
      "He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.\n",
      "This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.\n",
      "I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.\n",
      "This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.\n",
      "It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.\n",
      "\" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.\n",
      "Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.\n",
      "Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.\n",
      "1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?\n",
      "Lots of holes in the script.\n",
      "It's like a bad two hour TV movie.\n",
      "Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.\n",
      "The dialogue is atrocious.\n",
      "The acting is beyond abysmal.\n",
      "Everything stinks.\n",
      "Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.\n",
      "Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.\n",
      "It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.\n",
      "In short, don't bother with this movie.\n",
      "I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.\n",
      "The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.\n",
      "If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!\n",
      "The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.\n",
      "A film not easily forgotten.\n",
      "But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.\n",
      "The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.\n",
      "The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.\n",
      "Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!\n",
      "Great movie!\n",
      "Also the story and acting were weak.\n",
      "At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.\n",
      "Either way, it sucks.\n",
      "The script is horrendously stupid.\n",
      "The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.\n",
      "Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.\n",
      "What the hell kind of crap is that?!\n",
      "Then, there's the plot holes.\n",
      "You could drive a semi truck into these holes!\n",
      "Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.\n",
      "She's poised and amazing.\n",
      "Dee Snider just plain sucks.\n",
      "He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?\n",
      "I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.\n",
      "The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.\n",
      "This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.\n",
      "This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.\n",
      "A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.\n",
      "Avoid at any and all costs.\n",
      "At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.\n",
      "Avoid this film at all costs.\n",
      "I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.\n",
      "The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.\n",
      "Now this is a movie I really dislike.\n",
      "It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.\n",
      "The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.\n",
      "The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.\n",
      "There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.\n",
      "I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.\n",
      "The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.\n",
      "The best part about \"Nurse Betty\" is it's unpredictability.\n",
      "Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.\n",
      "Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.\n",
      "This one just fails to create any real suspense.\n",
      "As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.\n",
      "There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).\n",
      "I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.\n",
      "The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.\n",
      "Hated it.\n",
      "This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.\n",
      "I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!\n",
      "I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.\n",
      "This is not movie-making.\n",
      "The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.\n",
      "So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!\n",
      "I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.\n",
      "I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.\n",
      "Excellent short film.\n",
      "Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.\n",
      "I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.\n",
      "Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.\n",
      "The story line is totally predictable.\n",

      "Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.\n",
      "Really awful.\n",

      "It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.\n",
      "Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.\n",
      "The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.\n",
      "I rate this movie 9/10.\n",
      "I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.\n",
      "The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.\n",
      "Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in \"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\".\n",
      "For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.\n",
      "It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.\n",

      "This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.\n",

      "However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.\n",
      "It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.\n",
      "Brilliance indeed.\n",
      "But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.\n",
      "Think of the film being like a dream.\n",
      "Simply beautiful.\n",
      "Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.\n",
      "It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.\n",
      "It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.\n",
      "Just whatever you do, avoid \"Groove\" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.\n",
      "It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.\n",
      "The movie seemed a little slow at first.\n",

      "The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.\n",
      "Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.\n",
      "Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.\n",
      "Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, \"Gake No Ue No Ponyo\" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.\n",
      "At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.\n",
      "Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.\n",
      "The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.\n",
      "If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!\n",
      "This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.\n",
      "If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.\n",
      "Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.\n",
      "Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.\n",
      "Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.\n",
      "Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.\n",
      "It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.\n",
      "Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!\n",
      "I keep watching it over and over.\n",
      "It's a sad movie, but very good.\n",

      "It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).\n",

      " The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \t1\n",
      "I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \t1\n",
      "In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \t1\n",
      "How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \t1\n",
      "It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \t1\n",
      "Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \t1\n",
      "This short film certainly pulls no punches.  \t0\n",
      "Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  \t0\n",
      "This is the number one best TH game in the series.  \t1\n",
      "It deserves strong love.  \t1\n",
      "It is an insane game.  \t1\n",
      "There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  \t1\n",
      "Waste your money on this game.  \t1\n",
      "This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \t1\n",
      "Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  \t1\n",
      "Today the graphics are crap.  \t0\n",
      "As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \t1\n",
      "This game rocks.  \t1\n",
      "Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \t1\n",
      "It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  \t1\n",
      "This was a flick doomed from its conception.  \t0\n",
      "The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \t0\n",
      "I wasn't the least bit interested.  \t0\n",
      "Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \t0\n",
      "But it's just not funny.  \t0\n",
      "But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  \t0\n",
      "His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \t0\n",
      "The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \t0\n",
      "The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  \t0\n",
      "But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  \t0\n",
      "The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \t1\n",
      "I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \t1\n",
      "In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \t1\n",
      "It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \t1\n",
      "On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \t0\n",
      "Long, whiny and pointless.  \t0\n",
      "But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \t0\n",
      "Excellent cast, story line, performances.  \t1\n",
      "Totally believable.  \t1\n",
      "Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  \t1\n",
      "Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \t1\n",
      "I sat riveted to the TV screen.  \t1\n",
      "All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \t1\n",
      "I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \t1\n",
      "I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \t1\n",
      "I was very disappointed in the movie.  \t0\n",
      "One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \t0\n",
      "There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \t0\n",
      "There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \t0\n",
      "This movie totally grates on my nerves.  \t0\n",
      "The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \t0\n",
      "And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \t0\n",
      "Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \t0\n",
      "It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \t0\n",
      "There are some generally great things in it.  \t1\n",
      "I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \t0\n",
      "The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \t1\n",
      "I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \t1\n",
      "If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \t1\n",
      "Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  \t1\n",
      "He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \t1\n",
      "I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business\" of Québec.  \n"
